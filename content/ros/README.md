# ROS 
ROS stands for Robot Operating System, it is a collection of libraries and tools which you can use for developing software applications for robots. These libraries and tools that comprises ROS are installed on top of Ubuntu, they are released as distributions. We will be using **ROS Noetic** distribution which has a long-term support (LTS) until May, 2025.

:warning:  Please make sure you have installed Ubuntu 20, as ROS Noetic is compatible with Ubuntu 20.
